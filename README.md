## Q: What is the project AnimojiOnAndroid(VividFaces Android version) for?
## A: Android version of iOS’s animoji.

## Q: What is the status of the project currently?
## A: Collada models showing, morphing animation done.

## Q: why is this project being made?
## A: The format of Collada had been developed by khronos community for more than a decade. It is widely supported by 3D composing software and 3D engines. But the weakness of khronos community on development ability and control capability gives Collada other names of incompatibility and disability. I work on Collada many years before but now when I have to do some work on Collada format, I found I have to do hard coding from low level XML parsing. Re-inventing wheels on such a task did take time. I hope every 3D developers abandon Collada format right now and move to the next generation of 3D format. 

## Q: What the benefit of the project VividFaces Android?
## A: The apple’s animoji 3D model can be using and morphing animation is implemented on android phones. The cache mechanism is created which 3D model was cached as OPENGL ES data after first loading so as to shorten the loading process of minutes to seconds.
